# GitHub Pages Documentation

This directory contains the privacy policy page for the CSP Bypass Search Chrome Extension.

## Privacy Policy

The privacy policy is available at: `privacy-policy.html`

Once deployed to GitHub Pages, it will be accessible at:
`https://[your-username].github.io/CSPBypass/privacy-policy.html`

## Deployment

Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions. The workflow will automatically deploy the contents of this `docs/` folder to GitHub Pages when:

1. Changes are pushed to the `main` branch that affect files in the `docs/` folder
2. The workflow is manually triggered from the Actions tab

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. The workflow will automatically deploy when triggered
